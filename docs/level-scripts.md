# Level scripts, part 1 (runtime plan item Rt)

2026-10-08 America/Chicago. D-number to be assigned by the Integrator. Builds on the
script VM (`docs/script-vm.md`; the game's own test script passes 512 of 513 checks at
D145) and the native bindings (`docs/script-natives.md`). No script bytecode, listing,
level bytes or engine code was used or is committed.

## What it adds

- **`lbp-level`**: the PScript part now keeps its data (`PartData::script`): the script
  resource and, when the instance has a layout, one `ScriptField` per serialized layout
  field (name, machine type, value). Values: bool, char, s32, f32, v4, m44, Thing
  reference (Thing index), object reference (kind, and the text of a STRINGW/STRINGA on
  its first occurrence), and `NotStored` for a DIVERGENT field the instance does not
  serialize. The read order is unchanged (the module doc's SCRIPT rule). A PScript shared
  by back-reference is not repeated.
- **New crate `lbp-runtime`** (runtime only; the parsing crates do not depend on it):
  - `LevelWorld` implements the VM `World` from a read level: Thing handles are Thing
    indices; parent, first child and next sibling (children in Thing-list order); the
    world Thing (the one with PWorld); UID; world position = translation column of the
    POS matrix; `has_part` maps `PSpriteLight` to the reader's `SPRITE_LIGHT`; script
    members (`GET/SET_SP_MEMBER` on a Thing) start from the stored PScript fields;
    `WRITE` lines are kept.
  - `instances()`: every Thing with a PScript resource GUID, with its class when a
    script with that GUID is loaded.
  - `Runner`: starts a named function on an instance with the Thing as `this` in
    register 0, keeps scripts that yield, and resumes them once per `tick()`.
- **Example `level_scripts`** (PC): scripted Things per level, class resolution by GUID,
  stored field names against the class layout, function names over the classes in use,
  and optionally a run of named entry functions on one level.

## Evidence

CONFIRMED_FROM_COMMUNITY_CODE: the PScript / InstanceLayout / ScriptObjectUID layout
(Toolkit d6a2ef80, already recorded in the `parts.rs` module doc).

INFERRED (each is a place the PC run or RPCS3 can disagree):

| Rule | Choice | How it gets settled |
|---|---|---|
| Script members | A Thing's script fields are its `SP` members, by field name | `level_scripts`: stored names vs class field names (`fields_missing_in_class`) |
| `this` | The Thing, in register 0 | Faults when the first entry runs |
| Thing handle | Thing index in the level's list | Internal choice; never shown to scripts except through natives |
| Children order | Thing-list order | Scripts that walk children (`GetFirstChild`/`GetNextSibling`) |
| World position | POS world matrix translation, w as stored | RPCS3 comparison |
| Object references | Strings become string values; other kinds (arrays, instances, resources) are null for now and counted as `unconverted_values` | The PC count says whether they matter |

UNKNOWN: which functions the game calls when a scripted Thing is created and on each tick.
`level_scripts --all` reports the function names that have code across the classes levels
use; the entry names are passed with `--entry=` until that is settled.

## Verification

Cloud (Linux): `cargo fmt --all --check` clean;
`cargo clippy -q -p lbp-runtime -p lbp-script-vm -p lbp-level --all-targets -- -D warnings`
clean; `cargo test -q -p lbp-runtime -p lbp-level -p lbp-script-vm -p lbp-ui-script` all
pass. New tests:
- `lbp-level` `script_part_keeps_field_names_and_values`: an inline layout of four fields
  (bool, f32, a divergent s32, a wide-string object), with and without compressed
  integers.
- `lbp-runtime`: the Thing tree, UID, position, parts and members of a three-Thing level;
  a synthetic `Lamp.Tick` that increments a member, yields, and finishes on the next
  tick; missing function and missing class outcomes.

CI now also tests `lbp-runtime`.

Not tested: any real level or game script (PC only).

## PC checks

1. `cargo run -q -p lbp-runtime --example level_scripts -- <snapshot> <game dirs incl. the
   d133 edat overlay> --all local-analysis/<new>.json`. Report the summary line, the top
   `instances_by_class`, `unresolved_by_guid`, and the top 30 `function_names`.
2. Then, on one level with scripted Things (the empty test level, or the first story
   level), run with `--entry=<name>` for the likely create and update names from step 1,
   for example `--entry=OnCreate --entry=OnUpdate --ticks=30`. Report the printed run
   lines, the first faults and the top unbound natives.

Counts: +0 newly viewable, +0 newly Complete (no asset change).

## Part 2: Rookie Test create/update faults (2026-10-08)

Bound the world members and natives behind the most common faults of the D150 Rookie Test
run (`main_01_rookie_test`, `--entry=OnCreate__ --entry=Update__ --ticks=30`). Evidence is
the type tables of the user's scripts (field, property and function declarations with
machine types) and the local listings under ignored `local-analysis/` for how a result is
used; nothing from them is committed. Toolkit d6a2ef80 has none of these names.

| Item | Finding (label) | Binding |
|---|---|---|
| `Trigger_Speech_Bubble.IsTweaking` | A field of superclass `Tweakable` (bool, modifiers 0x1040), never in the stored layout (INFERRED: not serialized) | General: `LevelWorld::add_class_defaults` gives each scripted Thing every class and superclass field at its type default (`Vm::field_defaults`, shared with `instantiate`); stored values win |
| `Thing.SpriteLight` | `GET_SP_NATIVE_MEMBER` of type raw_ptr, then `SET_RP_MEMBER` FarDist (f32) and Color (v4) on it: the PSpriteLight part | Native member whose name is a reader part name (`thing::PARTS`) on any Thing script class: a part handle (`Raw(index + 1)`), `Raw(0)` when the Thing lacks the part; `ref_ptr` members of a handle keep what scripts write (reading an unwritten one is an error; part data is not read yet) |
| `Game.GetPlayOrEditMode__` | Returns s32 (`Game.EPlayOrEditMode`); `World.Update` takes the play-only branch on `== 0`, `World.RenderPreviewIcon` the edit branch on `== 1` (INFERRED) | `World::play_or_edit_mode`; LevelWorld: 0 (play) |
| `Game.GetNumPlayers__` | Already bound; LevelWorld lacked it | LevelWorld: 1 local player |
| `Audio.GetDialogueList__` | Returns s32 with builtin type 9, stored straight into `DialogueListFile` (same type) | `World::dialogue_list`; LevelWorld: 0 (no list loaded, INFERRED) |
| `Score_Board.GetShapeEditorColour__Q5Thing` | Declared native on `Thing` (returns v4); the VM named the referencing subclass | General VM fix: a native reached through a subclass reference goes to the host under the declaring class (`Vm::native_owner`). Bound `Thing.GetShapeEditorColour__Q5Thing` / `SetShapeEditorColour__Q5Thingr` on the PShape colour (packed 0xAARRGGBB, INFERRED byte order) |
| `PartList.HasPRenderMesh__Q5Thing` | Next fault after the above (21 Things) | Same part check as the other `HasP*` |

`level_scripts` now also writes `faults_by_kind` per entry (fault text with the Thing
number removed) and applies the class defaults before a run.

Results (PC, 01.33 with the d133 edat overlay; output
`local-analysis/d154-level-scripts-rookie-0133.json`), counting unit = scripted Thing:

| Entry | D150 done / fault / no_function | Now |
|---|---|---|
| OnCreate__ | 170 / 42 / 9 | 189 / 23 / 9 |
| Update__ | 0 / 22 / 199 | 21 / 1 / 199 |

Remaining faults (`faults_by_kind`): OnCreate `Native.SetAnimSpeed__Q5Thingf` (12,
Trigger_Speech_Bubble), `PartList.HasPCameraTweak__Q5Thing` (9), `Game.GetPlayerNumber__i`
(1, World), `Thing.SetRenderMeshEditorColourTint__Q5Thingr` (1, Score_Board); Update
`PWorld.GameMode` read through `World.World` before any script wrote it (1; needs PWorld
part data). The game's own test script still passes 512 of 513 checks
(`script_tests`, `local-analysis/d154-script-tests-0133.json`).

Tests: `lbp-runtime` `class_defaults_inherited_natives_and_parts` (superclass field
default under a stored value, part handle and its `ref_ptr` member, null part, non-part
name, players and mode, and an inherited native reported under its declaring class).

Counts: +0 newly viewable, +0 newly Complete (no asset change).

## Next

- Settle the entry names and call order from step 1 and the RPCS3 observations, then run
  the scripts each tick of the 30 Hz fixed update.
- Bind the natives step 2 reports, in call-count order.
- Object-reference values (arrays and instances) as VM heap objects.
