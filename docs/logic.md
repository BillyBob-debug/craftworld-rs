# Logic and circuits: the game's gadgets against the runtime

Lane: logic (docs/lanes/logic.md), decisions D1100-D1199. The oracle is game data, the
EBOOT (Ghidra bridge) and RPCS3 memory reads; nothing here needs a decrypted file.

## Part 1: census of the Rookie Test (D1100)

Counted from the level's Things (Rookie Test 0001e786, 3,247 Things; the Pod 00018fdb is
a shell of 6 Things with no switches, joints or chips, so its behaviour is all script).

Parts: SWITCH 914, SWITCH_KEY 507, MICROCHIP 262, PHYSICS_TWEAK 267, SWITCH_INPUT 31,
MATERIAL_TWEAK 61, EMITTER 24, JOINT 124, TRIGGER 113, CHECKPOINT 8, BODY 368, SCRIPT 221,
SEQUENCER 2, CONTROLINATOR 2, CREATURE 4, NPC 4, ENEMY 4, CAMERA_TWEAK 22.

Switches (type, count, what the runtime does):
- Computed (876 of 914, 96%): AND 14 ×37, countdown 15 ×73, timer 16 ×78, toggle 17 ×24,
  OR 21 ×48, XOR 22 ×2, NOT 23 ×27, selector 35 ×2, microchip 36 ×262, circuit board
  37 ×262, player sensor 3 ×25 and tag sensor 4 ×36.
- Sensors: the cone and layer tests always pass, and so do the player and team filters.
- Stored signal only (38): button 0 ×2, sticker 5 ×3, random 19 ×3, cutscene camera
  finished 32 ×11, magic mouth 34 ×17, control pad 38 ×2.

Other gadgets, before this lane:
- PHYSICS_TWEAK 267: read and dropped; movers, rotators, followers and anti-gravity
  tweakers were inert. Fixed for anti-gravity in Part 2.
- Joints 124 (piston 33, string 25, bolt 51, chain 4, spring-angular 4, motor 5, legacy
  2): simulated, but no switch signal drives a piston, motor or winch.
- MATERIAL_TWEAK 61: dropped; every shape uses friction 0.8, restitution 0.3, density 20.
- EMITTER 24, SWITCH_INPUT 31, SEQUENCER 2, CONTROLINATOR 2, creatures: dropped.
- BODY: all 368 have frozen != 0 (153 on a joint); they start asleep and wake on contact.

Fix order: 1 physics tweakers; 2 switch signals into pistons, motors, movers and
emitters; 3 SWITCH_INPUT, MATERIAL_TWEAK and EMITTER; 4 the 38 stored-signal switches and
the sensors' cone and layer tests; 5 sequencers, controlinators and creatures.

## Part 2: anti-gravity tweakers hold the walkway up (D1100)

The level's 267 PPhysicsTweak Things are now kept (`PartData.physics_tweak`). By
configuration: 0 ×169 (anti-gravity), 1 ×56, 11 ×35, and a few of 5, 8, 9 and 12.

The Rookie Test stop at x -385 (docs/level1-play.md Part 16) came from a frozen walkway
row falling as one island once Sackboy bumped column T2739. That column carries
anti-gravity tweaker T3090 (configuration 0, gravity 1, dampening [1, 1, 0],
lastKnownActivation 1), and so does T2736 at the row's other end.

lbp-sim now gives a body with a configuration 0 tweaker on its parent chain a gravity
scale of `1 - gravity × lastKnownActivation`. With that, the row stays up and the same
route inputs take Sackboy from x -385 to x 22,785 (tick 2012).
